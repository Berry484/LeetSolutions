# Leetcode_solutions

This repo has some of my personal LeetCode solutions in **C**.  
Problems are sorted by difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.  

I wrote a lot of these a while ago, so some solutions are quite shit and may not be the most optimal :).  
The goal here is mostly to keep track of my leetcode journey and have a reference for C solutions.
